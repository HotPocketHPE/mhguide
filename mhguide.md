# Introduction

Welcome! This is a guide for the game series Monster Hunter. The tips here will mainly apply to the games after and including Freedom Unite, and before World. Players of other MH games may still find some information useful though.

## What is This Guide?

**This guide is focused on explaining the game's mechanics.** The mechanics of MH are deep, multi-faceted, and not always clear, so the focus will be on them, with particular attention paid to the fundamentals of combat. Other aspects of the series, such as lore or detailed builds, are well-covered already across the Internet.

**This guide is focused on generalities, not specifics.** Detailed information specific to a certain game, like armor sets or monster tutorials, won't be included. The idea is to give you the skills needed to figure things out on your own, or at least to know what to Google. However, examples of specific situations will be used to illustrate general concepts.

**This guide is targeted towards late 2nd-4th gen games.** This means everything after and including MH Freedom Unite, and before MH World. The 5th generation games (World and Rise) changed many core mechanics of the series, so they will not be covered here. If you are playing MH2 or earlier, you probably know what you are doing, and don't need this guide.  

## Why Play Monster Hunter?

**Just boss fights!** Monster Hunter is made of almost entirely "boss fights"!

**Deep and unique combat system.** MH combat is very deep, and there is always something new to learn! Its combination of methodical pacing, 1v1 fights, and intense focus on positioning is wholly unique.

**Focus on efficiency.** Stylish moments are possible, but they take the backseat in MH: the focus is on playing quick and clean.

**Variable difficulty!** Early progression can be easy, while later hunts significantly up the challenge. Optional content in many games will truly test your skill, but if you need help, build your armor to focus on defense or play in multiplayer!

# Game Abbreviations and Short History

All of these may be preceded by MH, which simply stands for Monster Hunter. Only the "main" games are included here; this says nothing about the other games' quality (I quite like MH Frontier).

## First Generation
---
* MH1 - The original Monster Hunter on PS2. Introduced most core gameplay systems. Focuses on the survival aspect more than later games. 
* MHG - Monster Hunter G, on PS2. An expanded version of the original with a new and harder progression rank called G rank. Added Dual Blades (then called Dual Swords) in Japan. Subspecies introduced.
* F1/MHP - Freedom 1, on PSP. Also called Monster Hunter Portable. Portable adaptation of Monster Hunter G. Tweaks some aspects and adds a bit more content. Focuses on large monster battles more than the original.

## Second Generation
---
* MH2/MH2Dos/Dos - Monster Hunter 2 Dos, on PS2. Expands on the original's survival aspects with simulation-focused elements such as daytime and season cycles; also the last game to do this. Added Gunlance and Hunting Horn. Most MH1 monsters return, and many new monsters and maps were added. Only released in Japan, though a partial English translation patch is available.
* F2/P2nd - Freedom 2, on PSP. Also called Portable 2nd. Portable adaptation of Dos, removing many simulation elements to focus on the large monster combat. Added Long Sword.
* FU/P2ndG - Freedom Unite, on PSP. Also called Portable 2nd G. Expands on Freedom 2 with the return of G rank, new monsters, and some content ported from the subscription game MH Frontier. Survival aspects further deemphasized.

## Third Generation
---
* MH3/MHTri/Tri - Monster Hunter Tri, on Wii. Added underwater combat: being underwater gives different movement mechanics, monster movesets, and weapon movesets. Added Switch Axe, but many weapons from the older games are not present, due to the need for unique underwater movesets. Bowguns reworked. New monsters and maps, but many 1st and 2nd generation monsters do not return. 
* P3rd - Portable 3rd, on PSP. Portable adaptation of Tri. No underwater combat, but all weapons are present. Bowguns use old system. Has some monsters from Tri (many underwater-focused ones are absent), some additional 1st and 2nd generation monsters return, and new monsters added. Only released in Japan, though a partial English translation patch is available.
* 3U/3G - 3 Ultimate, on 3DS and Wii U. Also called 3 G. Expanded version of Tri with G rank. Underwater combat returns, along with all weapons. Bowguns use system from P3rd. All MHTri monsters and some P3rd monsters return.

## Fourth Generation
---
* MH4 - Monster Hunter 4, on 3DS. Underwater combat removed. Aerial attacks and mounting added, and maps are heavily focused on verticality. Added Charge Blade and Insect Glaive. Features Frenzy difficulty modifier. Only released in Japan.
* 4U/4G - 4 Ultimate, on 3DS. Also called 4 G. Expanded version of 4 with G rank. Features Apex and Wystone systems.
* Gen/X - Monster Hunter Generations, on 3DS. Also called Monster Hunter X (pronounced "cross"). Large amount of monsters and maps return. Features Arts and Styles system, Hyper monsters, and Deviant monsters.
* GU/XX - Generations Ultimate, on 3DS (Japan only) and Switch. Also called Monster Hunter XX (pronounced "double cross"). Expanded version of Generations with G rank. New Arts, Styles, and Deviants added.

## Fifth Generation
---
* MHW/World - Monster Hunter World, on PS4, XB1, and PC. Many game mechanics changed. Loading zones in maps removed. Singleplayer and multiplayer progression unified. Features Tempered and Arch-Tempered difficulty modifier.
* MHWI/Iceborne - Expansion DLC for World, on PS4, XB1, and PC. Master rank (new name for G rank) added. Features Clutch Claw.
* Rise - Monster Hunter Rise, on Switch and PC (forthcoming). Separate singleplayer quests, but multiplayer quest stats still scale with player count like World. Features Wirebugs. Maps are much more open than World.

# Terminology

* Blademaster - Melee weapon users. Most weapon types in the game fall under this. Uses Sharpness.
* Gunner - Ranged weapon users, aka Light Bowgun, Heavy Bowgun and Bow. Uses ammo/coatings and Critical Distance. Armor has about half the defense of Blademasters.
* Hitbox - The invisible zone that detects if an attack hits. Usually corresponds roughly with the parts moving on a monster during an attack, e.g. the tail during a tailspin. 
* Hitzone - The (multiplicative) damage modifier for hitting a certain area on the monster. Cutting, impact, shot, and all elements have unique values for each hitzone.
* I-frames - Stands for invincibility frames. A period of time where you cannot be hit by any attack (with extremely rare exceptions). Present on the basic roll, superman dive, and some weapon moves. 

# Simple Tips for Starting Out

* **Blademasters: Prioritize getting green sharpness!** Yellow sharpness (what most early weapons start with) will make you bounce a lot and lower your damage.
* **Start with the village quests!** They are scaled for singleplayer and are good for starting out. Other quests (called hub quests) are still soloable but new players may have difficulty doing this. Progressing in village quests often unlocks useful things like farm upgrades.
* **Look up the key quests online!** Only certain quests (called key quests) are required to progress in the game. Feel free to do as many quests as you want, but you will likely want to skip the boring gathering quests that appear early on.
* **Use the farm!** It helps you get common items, which saves a lot of hassle. In some games you need to spend points to upgrade your farm, prioritize doing this.
* **4th gen games: Use item sets!** An option from the item box, item sets allow you to quickly restock and swap your items between quests. Simply add the items you commonly use to your pouch and register a set. Selecting it will pull items from your box to match that set as closely as possible.
* **Pre-4th gen games: Kill small monsters before focusing on the large one!** If you leave them alone, small monsters will annoy you, interrupt your attacks, and even cause you to get hit by the large monster! Killing them solves this, usually they have low HP and will die in a few attacks.
* **3rd and 4th gen games: Bring Dung Bombs to quests with multiple large monsters!** Hitting a monster with a Dung Bomb causes it to move zones after a bit. Fighting multiple monsters at once is difficult and inconsistent, so avoid it when possible. 
* **Emulators: Use speedup if it's available!** Some quests (such as gathering, small monster killing, and sieges) are boring and can take a bit. Speedup will save time and make the game more enjoyable. **Don't use this in multiplayer without other players' consent!** 

# Basics of Dealing Damage

This section will tell you what you need to focus on to deal good damage, without getting into the nitty-gritty details of the full damage formula itself.

Fundamentally, your dealt damage looks like this:

> Damage = Raw Damage + Elemental Damage 

> Raw Damage = Player Damage * Sharpness (Blademasters only) * Critical Distance (Gunners only) * Motion Value * Hitzone

"Raw" damage here means non-elemental damage. Elemental damage will be covered shortly.

## Player Damage

This is mostly influenced by preparation outside the hunt. Build better gear to raise this!

Your weapon itself is quite important. Higher number = more damage! Blademasters should pay special attention to the weapon's Sharpness (see below), while Gunners should look at how much of each ammo type the weapon can hold.

Affinity is your critical hit chance. A crit (bright red flash) will deal 25% more damage, while a negative crit (dark red flash) will deal 25% less. Explosions (such as Gunlance shells or Charge Blade phials) and some other attacks (such as bowgun elemental shots) cannot crit or negative crit, but most attacks can. 

Many armor skills will also increase your damage, such as Attack Up. Most of these add to your damage, which is better the earlier in the game you are. Skills that multiply your damage, such as Adrenaline, or boost your Affinity, such as Critical Eye, are better later in the game.

If you are playing FU, 3U, or 4U, **do not compare damage numbers between weapon types!** The reason is dumb and annoying. Players of P3rd and GU do not have to worry about this. 

## Blademasters - Sharpness

Sharpness is a mechanic for Blademasters. Hitting the monster will temporarily lower your Sharpness, and using a Whetstone will restore it.

Firstly, having higher Sharpness levels will raise your damage. This can be substantial, so don't overlook this, and try to keep your weapon sharpened!

Additionally, hitting hard monster parts and/or being on a low Sharpness level can cause you to bounce. See the Hitzones section for more on this.

## Gunners - Critical Distance

Critical Distance (unrelated to crits from your Affinity) is a mechanic for Gunners that multiplies your shots' power based on your distance from the monster. 

Being too close or too far away will hurt your damage, while being just close enough will raise it. You can tell if you are in proper crit distance range by watching the yellow hit sparks. Bigger = better!

Different ammo types have different crit distances. Pierce's crit distance is further away than Normal's, so watch your positioning! Some shots, such as elemental shots, do not use crit distance, but most common ammo does.

## Motion Values

Motion values (MVs) are what makes attacks weak or strong. Weak moves like Longsword's poke have low motion values, while strong ones like the Greatsword's level 3 charge slash have high motion values. Gunners have motion values tied to their shot types.

MVs are notated as percentages without the % sign. Often you can guess the approximate value for a move after some time playing, but look them up if you are unsure! It may change what moves you prioritize.

## Hitzones

Hitzones are what makes monster parts hard or soft. Soft parts like Rathian's head have high hitzones, while hard parts like Rathian's back have low hitzones. The higher the hitzone, the more damage you deal!

Like motion values, hitzones are notated as percentages without the % sign. You can also tell how high a hitzone is in-game by the amount of hitstop (2nd gen) or the size of the blood splatter (3rd and 4th gen). Gunners may have trouble seeing hitzones in-game, looking them up is recommended.

For Blademaster, hitting particularly hard parts will cause you to bounce. Bouncing locks you into a dangerously long animation and doubles the hit's Sharpness usage, so try to avoid it when you can. Higher Sharpness levels will make it harder to bounce.

Some moves cannot bounce, but you will still get the double sharpness loss, and your damage will be low because of the bad hitzone. Unless you are trying to break a specific part, you are better off hitting the good hitzones.

## Elemental Damage

Elemental damage works similarly to Raw damage, with one big exception.

> Elemental Damage = Player Element * Elemental Hitzone

Elemental damage **ignores your move's motion value!** Even a weak attack like the Longsword poke does just as much elemental damage as the Hammer's golf swing!

It follows that only the speed and number of hits matter. Fast weapons like Sword and Shield and Dual Blades thus excel at dealing elemental damage, while slow weapons like Greatsword and Hammer struggle.

Fast weapons can deal a lot more damage with the proper element setup, so pay attention to it if you are using those weapons! Slow weapons should mostly ignore element, while medium speed weapons can use it if they wish.

## Player Element

Like Player Damage, this will come from your weapon and gear. Skills such as Element Attack Up or \[specific element\] Attack +1/+2/+3 will boost your element.

For Blademasters, higher Sharpness levels boosts your element.

Bowguns do not have intrinsic element! Instead, some bowguns shoot elemental shots. The amount of element dealt will scale with your raw damage, so balance your bowgun's damage with its ammo capabilities for best results.

## Elemental Hitzones

This also works similarly to raw hitzones, with a few differences.

Bad raw hitzones are often good elemental hitzones, while good raw hitzones can be either good or bad elemental hitzones. Unlike raw damage, most monsters are particularly weak to a certain element. Usually, you can either guess what the monster's weakness would be (such as Rathalos and water), or look at the resistances on the monster's armor.

Unfortunately, beyond these generalizations, elemental hitzones are very difficult to guess in-game, so looking them up is highly recommended.

# Basics of Armor and Skills

## Skill Points

Each piece of your armor gives you a number of points in at least one skill. **Every skill only activates with at least 10 points; having less than 10 points in a skill does nothing!**

Some skills (like Attack) give additional benefits from having 15 or 20 points.

Having -10 points in a skill will give the negative version of that skill. Some of these aren't so bad, while others are very dangerous!

## Slots and Decorations

Each piece of armor, your weapon, and your charm (in 3rd and 4th gen) all have 0 to 3 slots. These slots are used for decorations.

Decorations are an additional source of skill points. Each one takes from 1 to 3 slots. The more slots a decoration takes, the more points it gives.

## Brief Skill Overview



# Hunting Fundamentals

Your performance as a hunter rests on these skills. Know them well!

## The Essence of Combat

Monster Hunter differentiates itself from other combat systems with three key principles: **positioning, commitment,** and **defensive play.**

Unlike many other games, overwhelming the enemy with offense is **very difficult**. Instead, you need to **position** yourself to both respect the monster's options and open up avenues for attacks on weak locations.

Recklessness is a death sentence, as almost everything you do **cannot be canceled out of!** Be deliberate in your actions, and anticipate what will happen in the next few seconds! 

## Foundational Concepts

### Openings

An opening is a time when you can attack without fear of retaliation. Some may be short, others long. Many of these arise from certain monster moves, either because you are safe from the attack in a certain area, or from the monster recovering afterwards.

> Example: Any Weapon vs. Rathian. Rathian's triple fireball can be somewhat dangerous at range, but if you are standing to her side, the weak head becomes a wide open target for the whole duration, and you can attack freely as the fireballs harmlessly fly away from you. 

### Commitment

In Monster Hunter, every action prevents you from doing other actions for a certain amount of time. This property is called commitment; slow attacks commit you more, while fast attacks commit you less. Using items such as potions also involves commitment.

Try and match your level of commitment to the length of openings. On short openings, such as a monster's small recovery period after attacking, get a quick hit in. On long openings, such as a trip, unleash your big damage-dealing moves!

> Example: Dual Blades vs. Rathian. The Dual Blades' Demon Dance is a very powerful attack, but it also takes a long time to execute. Using the Demon Dance on smaller openings, such as when Rathian lands after a flip, is dangerous. Instead, use those times to deal small hits to the legs. Then, when she trips, rush to the head and Dance away! 

### Positioning

Positioning describes where you are relative to the monster. There are two components of this: distance and orientation.

Being closer to some monsters is advantageous, while others work better further away. Gunners should pay special attention to this: the Critical Distance mechanic ties your damage directly to your distance from the monster!

> Example: Any Weapon vs. Rathian. Being far away from Rathian can be dangerous, as her triple fireball spreads out while flying. Staying close to her guards against this, but not too close! If you are right next to her, her legs will trample you as she moves and her horizontal tailspin will be difficult to escape. Experiment and find the optimal distance!

Orientation is the angle you're at relative to the monster, such as in front, to the left/right side, or behind. Certain moves are much easier to dodge when standing to the side, while others are more difficult. Some are easier to avoid on a particular side

> Example: Any Weapon vs. Rathian. Rathian's charge can be very difficult to avoid when both in front and close to her. Staying to the side makes it much easier to dodge. Don't wait for her to start the charge: move there in advance!

### Evading

The basic roll is an invaluable part of your toolset. For a small stamina cost, it will quickly move you in the direction you're facing. Use this to quickly get out of harm's way, or into 

Superman dive

### Guarding

Heavy shields

Light shields

## Intermediate Techniques

### Invincibility Frames

Invincibility Frames, or iframes, are periods of time where you cannot be hit by any attack. By default, the basic roll has 0.2 seconds of iframes (6 frames @ 30fps). 0.2 seconds may seem short, and it is compared to other games like Dark Souls, but that short burst can be enough to get you out of a sticky situation.

Iframes are best used against attacks where the hitbox is small, moves quickly, or lasts for a short amount of time. Right before you are hit, roll *towards* these attacks: rolling towards and through them will move you through the hitbox more quickly than rolling with it will.

> Example: Any Weapon vs. Nargacuga. Nargacuga's tail whip is a perfect candidate for iframing: fast-moving, small, and short. Right before you see the tail hit you, roll through it. If done right, you will pass through unscathed! If not, your timing was off, so try again when the chance presents itself. It's better to roll early than to roll late, so keep that in mind if you're having trouble.

With enough skill and knowledge, or in desperate circumstances, iframes can also be used to dodge other attacks, but this is difficult and risky. Some attacks cannot be iframed, as they are too large, slow-moving, or lengthy.

> Example: Any Weapon vs. Gravios. Gravios's "fire fart" covers a wide area, stays in one spot, and lasts a long time. This attack is completely impossible to iframe, so don't try it unless you want some new burns to show off.  

### Setups

A setup is where the hunter seemingly attacks at nothing, only to have the monster move into the strike at the last moment! This takes advantage of monsters' predictability to deal big damage. Setups are most useful on heavy weapons with powerful attacks, but other weapons (such as Longsword) can sometimes find utility for them. More than any other weapon, setups are the Greatsword's lifeblood!

> Example: Greatsword vs. Glavenus. After Glavenus slams his tail into the ground, watch his head! He will bring it near where the tail used to be. When you dodge a tailslam, charge your GS near his tail, and watch as his head moves into your strike! If you miss, note what aim adjustments you need to make, and try again.

### Baiting Attacks

Many monster attacks are more common at certain ranges and positions. If a certain attack is very punishable, staying at that range/position to see it more often (baiting the attack) can be useful.

> Example: Any Weapon vs. Plesioth (2nd gen). Plesioth is an infuriating fight for many, but his AI can be baited to the point of brokenness. Standing in front of Plesioth at a decent distance away will almost always result in the water beam, which can be easily dodged and punished. This strategy will trivialize the fight for ranged weapons, and make things much easier for melee weapons without shields. 

## Advanced Techniques

### Angling Strikes

Hitting the monster from an unorthodox angle can be advantageous in many circumstances. While your evasive options after attacking are constrained to only three directions, the angle of the attack beforehand isn't, so aiming in a certain direction can let you control this in advance.

> Example: Hammer vs. Khezu. Khezu's infamous electric zap is the bane of many a new hunter, but with experience under your belt, you can turn this frustrating attack into a chance for more damage.
When you are using your superpound, try hitting the head from the side during openings. If Khezu does his electric zap, simply side roll to safety!

> Example: Any Weapon vs. Rajang. Avoiding Rajang's punches and zigzags can be difficult, but they are weak to the left when close. When going for hits, angle them so you can roll into the left corner (Rajang's right) of Rajang's body. In this spot, his zigzags and punches will whizz past your head! 

### Sweet Spots

A sweet spot is a specific position where an attack won't hit you. These are often close to the monster, giving you a chance to get some hits in during the attack. If you are even a bit off on your positioning though, it's very likely you will be hit.

> Example: Any Weapon vs. Glavenus. Glavenus's charged tailspin covers a wide area and does massive damage, but there is a sweet spot! As he charges the spin in his mouth, sit under his tail, right next to his foot. If done correctly, you won't get a scratch! This is also a great opportunity to hit his heated tail.

### Stagger Control

Ever wondered what makes a monster stagger? Each part in a monster has two invisible numbers: stagger buildup and stagger threshold. sDealing damage to a part adds that damage to the part's stagger buildup, and if the buildup
exceeds the stagger threshold, the monster becomes staggered, and the buildup is reset to 0.

Importantly, the stagger threshold for a part never changes. This means that the same amount of hits from the same attack on the same part will always stagger the monster!

From this, the concept of stagger control arises. Figure out how many hits of a certain move on a certain part will cause a stagger. Then, deal just enough hits to that part so that it's buildup is one hit away from reaching the threshold. You now have a guarantee that the next hit to that part will cause a stagger.

The power of this technique lies in converting unsafe attacks into safe ones. Because your next hit wil stagger, even small openings become opportunities for strong attacks. Don't miss though, or else you might be in for a world of hurt!

> Example: Greatsword vs. Tigrex (2nd and 3rd gen). Inexperienced players will have trouble with this monster's unrelenting pace and freight-train charges, but experienced players can use stagger control to great effect.

> First, play safe and find out what combination of attacks to the head will make him stagger; for instance, an uncharged draw slash and a level 3 charged slash. Then, look for safe openings like the bite or spin to get a quick draw slash hit in.

> Finally, punish his head turning towards you with a level 3, and watch him stagger as you deal vicious damage!

### Head Turns

Many monsters (especially older ones) will pivot in place after an attack in order to face you. This is called a head turn, and can be leveraged in a number of ways.

Because the head is weak for most monsters, and head turns move it quite predictably, these turns can be consistent sources of small openings. Be careful though, as you will still have to deal with the following attack!

> Example: Any Weapon vs. Rathian. Rathian will head turn 
to face you after every attack, and her head is very weak, so use this to get some easy hits in! Beware her charge afterwards though, and try to position yourself to avoid it.

The small opening created by a head turn is great for cashing in your built-up stagger! See the [Stagger Control](#stagger-control) section for more on this.

If the angle the monster has to turn is big enough, it will execute the turn in two parts. By moving against the direction of rotation for the second part, the monster won't be able to switch directions, creating space.

> Example: Any Weapon vs. Akantor. Akantor's massive body and proclivity for charging makes standing in front of him very hazardous. Move against the second part of his head turn to give yourself some breathing room, especially if you are near a wall!
