# MH Guide

Welcome! This is a guide for the game series Monster Hunter. The tips here will mainly apply to the games after and including Freedom Unite, and before World. Players of other MH games may still find some information useful though.

# Game Abbreviations and Short History

All of these may be preceded by MH, which simply stands for Monster Hunter. Only the "main" games are included here; this says nothing about the other games' quality (I quite like MH Frontier).

1st Generation
---
* MH1 - The original Monster Hunter on PS2. Focuses on the survival aspect more than later games. 
* MHG - Monster Hunter G, on PS2. An expanded version of the original with a new and harder progression rank called G rank. Added Dual Blades (then called Dual Swords) in Japan. Subspecies introduced.
* F1/MHP - Freedom 1, on PSP. Also called Monster Hunter Portable. Portable adaptation of Monster Hunter G. Tweaks some aspects and adds a bit more content. Focuses on large monster battles more than the original.

2nd Generation
---
* MH2/MH2Dos/Dos - Monster Hunter 2 Dos, on PS2. Expands on the original's survival aspects with simulation-focused elements such as daytime and season cycles; also the last game to do this. Added Gunlance and Hunting Horn. Most MH1 monsters return, and many new monsters and maps were added. Only released in Japan, though a partial English translation patch is available.
* F2/P2nd - Freedom 2, on PSP. Also called Portable 2nd. Portable adaptation of Dos, removing many simulation elements to focus on the large monster combat. Added Long Sword.
* FU/P2ndG - Freedom Unite, on PSP. Also called Portable 2nd G. Expands on Freedom 2 with the return of G rank, new monsters, and some content ported from the subscription game MH Frontier. Survival aspects further deemphasized.

3rd Generation
---
* MH3/MHTri/Tri - Monster Hunter Tri, on Wii. Added underwater combat: being underwater gives different movement mechanics, monster movesets, and weapon movesets. Added Switch Axe, but many weapons from the older games are not present, due to the need for unique underwater movesets. Bowguns reworked. New monsters and maps, but many 1st and 2nd generation monsters do not return. 
* P3rd - Portable 3rd, on PSP. Portable adaptation of Tri. No underwater combat, but all weapons are present. Bowguns use old system. Has some monsters from Tri (many underwater-focused ones are absent), some additional 1st and 2nd generation monsters return, and new monsters added. Only released in Japan, though a partial English translation patch is available.
* 3U/3G - 3 Ultimate, on 3DS and Wii U. Also called 3 G. Expanded version of Tri with G rank. Underwater combat returns, along with all weapons. Bowguns use system from P3rd. All MHTri monsters and some P3rd monsters return.

4th Generation
---
* MH4 - Monster Hunter 4, on 3DS. Underwater combat removed. Aerial attacks and mounting added, and maps are heavily focused on verticality. Added Charge Blade and Insect Glaive. Features Frenzy difficulty modifier. Only released in Japan.
* 4U/4G - 4 Ultimate, on 3DS. Also called 4 G. Expanded version of 4 with G rank. Features Apex and Wystone systems.
* Gen/X - Monster Hunter Generations, on 3DS. Also called Monster Hunter X (pronounced "cross"). Large amount of monsters and maps return. Features Arts and Styles system, Hyper monsters, and Deviant monsters.
* GU/XX - Generations Ultimate, on 3DS (Japan only) and Switch. Also called Monster Hunter XX (pronounced "double cross"). Expanded version of Generations with G rank. New Arts, Styles, and Deviants added.

5th Generation
---
* MHW/World - Monster Hunter World, on PS4, XB1, and PC. Many game mechanics changed. Loading zones in maps removed. Singleplayer and multiplayer progression unified. Features Tempered and Arch-Tempered difficulty modifier.
* MHWI/Iceborne - Expansion DLC for World, on PS4, XB1, and PC. Master rank (new name for G rank) added. Features Clutch Claw.
* Rise - Monster Hunter Rise, on Switch and PC (forthcoming). Separate singleplayer quests, but multiplayer quest stats still scale with player count like World. Features Wirebugs. Maps are much more open than World.

# Terminology

## Mechanics

* Hitbox - The invisible zone that detects if an attack hits. Usually corresponds roughly with the parts moving on a monster during an attack, e.g. the tail during a tailspin. 
* Hitzone - The (multiplicative) damage modifier for hitting a certain area on the monster. Cutting, impact, shot, and all elements have unique values for each hitzone.
* I-frames - Stands for invincibility frames. A period of time where you cannot be hit by any attack (with extremely rare exceptions). Present on the basic roll, superman dive, and some weapon moves. 


# How Damage Works

To defeat monsters, you need to deal damage, obviously! Knowing how damage works will make your hunts faster and cleaner.

## The Basic Damage Formula

> Damage = Weapon Damage * Motion Value * Monster Hitzone

## Weapon Damage

This number is mostly derived from pre-hunt preparation. Crafting good weapons and armor with damage-boosting skills will raise this.

> True Raw = (Weapon True Raw + Additive Skills) * Multiplicative Skills

* Weapon True Raw - The base damage of your weapon. In some games, not equal to what is shown on your equipment screen. See Display Raw below for more. 
* Additive Skills - Skills that add to your raw, such as the Attack Up skills. Better earlier in the game.
* Multiplicative Skills - Skills that multiply your raw, such as Adrenaline while at low health. Better later in the game. 

> Display Raw = True Raw * Display Raw Modifier

* Display Raw Modifier - Each weapon type has a modifier that inflates the displayed damage of the weapon in the equipment and status screen, in an attempt to convey the general speed/damage of it's moves. For example, Hammer and Greatsword hit slowly but do a lot of damage per hit, and thus have much higher modifiers than Sword and Shield or Dual Blades, which do low damage per hit but can attack very quickly. Again, **this does not actually affect your damage dealt, only how it is shown to you in-game.**

In Portable 3rd, Generations/Generations Ultimate, and Rise, the true raw is always shown, so you don't have to worry about the display raw modifier. Hooray!

> Average Weapon Damage = True Raw * Sharpness Modifier * (1 + 0.25 * (Affinity Percentage / 100))

* Sharpness Modifier - Having higher sharpness will raise this. Since sharpness both helps you avoid bouncing and increases your damage, it is a useful thing to have. **Gunners do not have sharpness.**
* Affinity Percentage - Critical hit rate. Critical hits will make you deal 25% more damage, and negative critical hits (produced by negative affinity) will lower your damage by 25%. Gets better the later in the game you are, since it multiplies your weapon's raw.

## Motion Values

Motion values (MVs) measure the relative strength of each hit, notated as percentages without the % sign. Usually you can intuitively guess these; slow and strong hits like Hammer's golf swing have high MVs (90 in GU), while fast and weak hits like Longsword's poke have low MVs (14 in GU).

This is where your skill as a hunter comes in! Analyze the situation and decide which move is appropriate. For very fast monsters, perhaps a flurry of low-MV moves is best, while slower monsters may allow you to pull off many high-MV moves.

Attacks with high MVs are usually either slow/long (Dual Blades' full Demon Dance, Charge Blade's Super Amped Elemental Discharge) or require setup in advance (Hammer's Charged Superpound, Greatsword's Level 3 Charge Slash). Find openings for these moves, or create your own if you can!

## Hitzones

Hitzones multiply the damage dealt by your attack based on where the attack hit on the monster. Usually parts that look "hard" like Garuga's back have low hitzones (15 with cutting in GU), and parts that look "soft" like Garuga's head have high hitzones (65 with cutting in GU).

In addition to hurting your damage, attacking a hitzone that's too low will cause your weapon to bounce off. This locks you into a long animation, so try not to hit these parts. Having higher sharpness will make it harder to bounce, and some attacks cannot bounce.

There are three types of "raw" hitzones: cutting, impact, and shot. Each weapon does mostly one type of raw damage. Some monsters' hitzones are better overall for a certain damage type, so try switching weapons if you're bouncing a lot or if good hitzones are difficult to reach.

To tell approximately how high a hitzone is in-game, look at the amount of hitstop you get in 1st and 2nd generation games, and the size of the blood splatter in 3rd and 4th generation. Gunners may have trouble with this unfortunately. If you want to know the exact values, the internet is your friend!

Explosions (such as Gunlance shells, Charge Blade phial explosions, and bombs) ignore hitzones! Use this to attack from new angles, or to break a particularly tough part. 

Positioning is key to taking advantage of hitzones. Learn where the good hitzones are and try to stay near them to get big damage! However, often the weakest part of the monster (like the head) is the most dangerous place to be, so temper aggression with awareness for best results.

# Simple Tips for Starting Out

## Non-Combat

* **Blademasters: Prioritize getting green sharpness!** Yellow sharpness (what most early weapons start with) will make you bounce a lot and lower your damage.
* **Start with the village quests!** They are scaled for singleplayer and are good for starting out. Other quests (called hub quests) are still soloable but new players may have difficulty doing this. Progressing in village quests often unlocks useful things like farm upgrades.
* **Look up the key quests online!** Only certain quests (called key quests) are required to progress in the game. Feel free to do as many quests as you want, but you will likely want to skip the boring gathering quests that appear early on.
* **Use the farm!** It helps you get common items, which saves a lot of hassle. In some games you need to spend points to upgrade your farm, prioritize doing this.
* **4th gen games: Use item sets!** An option from the item box, item sets allow you to quickly restock and swap your items between quests. Simply add the items you commonly use to your pouch and register a set. Selecting it will pull items from your box to match that set as closely as possible.
* **Pre-4th gen games: Kill small monsters before focusing on the large one!** If you leave them alone, small monsters will annoy you, interrupt your attacks, and even cause you to get hit by the large monster! Killing them solves this, usually they have low HP and will die in a few attacks.
* **3rd and 4th gen games: Bring Dung Bombs to quests with multiple large monsters!** Hitting a monster with a Dung Bomb causes it to move zones after a bit. Fighting multiple monsters at once is difficult and inconsistent, so avoid it when possible. 
* **Emulators: Use speedup if it's available!** Some quests (such as gathering, small monster killing, and sieges) are boring and can take a bit. Speedup will save time and make the game more enjoyable. **Don't use this in multiplayer without other players' consent!**

## Combat 

* **Focus on not getting hit!** MH is a very defensive game. Getting hit will interrupt your attacks and force you to heal. Conversely, avoiding damage will let you take advantage of more openings. In MH, *a good defense is a good offense!*
* **Observe the monster's tells!** What are the tells for each move? Some moves (such as Garuga's infamous instant charge) don't have tells, but can only be performed in certain circumstances (such as when Garuga is facing you and isn't doing another move). Take advantage of this, and position accordingly!
* **Observe the monster's patterns!** 

# Hunting Fundamentals

Your performance as a hunter rests on these skills. Know them well!

## Foundational Concepts

### Openings

An opening is a time when you can attack without fear of retaliation. Some may be short, others long. Many of these arise from certain monster moves, either because you are safe from the attack in a certain area, or from the monster recovering afterwards.

> Example: Any Weapon vs. Rathian. Rathian's triple fireball can be somewhat dangerous at range, but if you are standing to her side, the weak head becomes a wide open target for the whole duration, and you can attack freely as the fireballs harmlessly fly away from you. 

### Commitment

In Monster Hunter, every action prevents you from doing other actions for a certain amount of time. This property is called commitment; slow attacks commit you more, while fast attacks commit you less. Using items such as potions also involves commitment.

Try and match your level of commitment to the length of openings. On short openings, such as a monster's small recovery period after attacking, get a quick hit in. On long openings, such as a trip, unleash your big damage-dealing moves!

> Example: Dual Blades vs. Rathian. The Dual Blades' Demon Dance is a very powerful attack, but it also takes a long time to execute. Using the Demon Dance on smaller openings, such as when Rathian lands after a flip, is dangerous. Instead, use those times to deal small hits to the legs. Then, when she trips, rush to the head and Dance away! 

### Positioning

Positioning describes where you are relative to the monster. There are two components of this: distance and orientation.

Being closer to some monsters is advantageous, while others work better further away. Gunners should pay special attention to this: the Critical Distance mechanic ties your damage directly to your distance from the monster!

> Example: Any Weapon vs. Rathian. Being far away from Rathian can be dangerous, as her triple fireball spreads out while flying. Staying close to her guards against this, but not too close! If you are right next to her, her legs will trample you as she moves and her horizontal tailspin will be difficult to escape. Experiment and find the optimal distance!

Orientation is the angle you're at relative to the monster, such as in front, to the left/right side, or behind. Certain moves are much easier to dodge when standing to the side, while others are more difficult. Some are easier to avoid on a particular side

> Example: Any Weapon vs. Rathian. Rathian's charge can be very difficult to avoid when both in front and close to her. Staying to the side makes it much easier to dodge. Don't wait for her to start the charge: move there in advance!

## Intermediate Techniques

### Invincibility Frames

Invincibility Frames, or iframes, are periods of time where you cannot be hit by any attack. By default, the basic roll has 0.2 seconds of iframes (6 frames @ 30fps). 0.2 seconds may seem short, and it is compared to other games like Dark Souls, but that short burst can be enough to get you out of a sticky situation.

Iframes are best used against attacks where the hitbox is small, moves quickly, or lasts for a short amount of time. Right before you are hit, roll *towards* these attacks: rolling towards and through them will move you through the hitbox more quickly than rolling with it will.

> Example: Any Weapon vs. Nargacuga. Nargacuga's tail whip is a perfect candidate for iframing: fast-moving, small, and short. Right before you see the tail hit you, roll through it. If done right, you will pass through unscathed! If not, your timing was off, so try again when the chance presents itself. It's better to roll early than to roll late, so keep that in mind if you're having trouble.

With enough skill and knowledge, or in desperate circumstances, iframes can also be used to dodge other attacks, but this is difficult and risky. Some attacks cannot be iframed, as they are too large, slow-moving, or lengthy.

> Example: Any Weapon vs. Gravios. Gravios's "fire fart" covers a wide area, stays in one spot, and lasts a long time. This attack is completely impossible to iframe, so don't try it unless you want some new burns to show off.  

### Setups

A setup is where the hunter seemingly attacks at nothing, only to have the monster move into the strike at the last moment! This takes advantage of monsters' predictability to deal big damage. Setups are most useful on heavy weapons with powerful attacks, but other weapons (such as Longsword) can sometimes find utility for them. More than any other weapon, setups are the Greatsword's lifeblood!

> Example: Greatsword vs. Glavenus. After Glavenus slams his tail into the ground, watch his head! He will bring it near where the tail used to be. When you dodge a tailslam, charge your GS near his tail, and watch as his head moves into your strike! If you miss, note what aim adjustments you need to make, and try again.

### Baiting Attacks

> Example: Heavy Bowgun vs. Plesioth. 

## Advanced Techniques

### Angling Strikes

Hitting the monster from an unorthodox angle can be advantageous in many circumstances. While your evasive options after attacking are constrained to only three directions, the angle of the attack beforehand isn't, so aiming in a certain direction can let you control this in advance.

> Example: Hammer vs. Khezu. Khezu's infamous electric zap is the bane of many a new hunter, but with experience under your belt, you can turn this frustrating attack into a chance for more damage.
When you are using your superpound, try hitting the head from the side during openings. If Khezu does his electric zap, simply side roll to safety!

> Example: Hammer vs. Rajang. Avoiding Rajang's punches can be difficult, but they 

### Sweet Spots

A sweet spot is a specific position where an attack won't hit you. 

> Example: Any Weapon vs. Glavenus. Glavenus's charged tailspin covers a wide area and does massive damage, but you can use this powerful move as a chance to deal some damage!

### Stagger Control

Ever wondered what makes a monster stagger? Each part in a monster has two invisible numbers: stagger buildup and stagger threshold. Dealing damage to a part adds that damage to the part's stagger buildup, and if the buildup
exceeds the stagger threshold, the monster becomes staggered, and the buildup is reset to 0.

Importantly, the stagger threshold for a part never changes. This means that the same amount of hits from the same attack on the same part will always stagger the monster!

From this, the concept of stagger control arises. Figure out how many hits of a certain move on a certain part will cause a stagger. Then, deal just enough hits to that part so that it's buildup is one hit away from reaching the threshold. You now have a guarantee that the next hit to that part will cause a stagger.

The power of this technique lies in converting unsafe attacks into safe ones. Because your next hit wil stagger, even small openings become opportunities for strong attacks. Don't miss though, or else you might be in for a world of hurt!

> Example: Greatsword vs. Tigrex (2nd and 3rd gen). Inexperienced players will have trouble with this monster's unrelenting pace and freight-train charges, but experienced players can use stagger control to great effect.
First, play safe and find out what combination of attacks to the head will make him stagger; for instance, an uncharged draw slash and a level 3 charged slash.
Then, look for safe openings like the bite or spin to get a quick draw slash hit in.
Finally, punish his head turning towards you with a level 3, and watch him stagger as you deal vicious damage!
